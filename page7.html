            As they are speaking, hired murders are being sent to kill Banquo and his Son. Inside, he is fighting with his conscience, and regretting his actions but also doubling down and continuing. He has become a broken man, always paranoid and fearful. He now feels he needs to protect Lady Macbeth by not telling her what he did.
